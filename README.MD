# SAT-style PDF MCQ Extractor

This Python script extracts multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from SAT-style practice test PDFs and saves them in a structured JSON format. It's designed to handle the typical layout and formatting of official digital SAT practice PDFs.

---

## Overview

Standardized test PDFs (like those from the SAT) often contain non-question content such as instructions, headers, and filler pages. This script performs the following:

- Parses text from each PDF page
- Removes unwanted lines and pages
- Identifies multiple-choice questions with options
- Outputs clean and structured JSON

---

## Usage

### Run the script from terminal:

```bash
python extract_questions.py <input_pdf> <output_json>
```

**Example:**

```bash
python extract_questions.py sat-practice-test-4-digital.pdf extracted_questions_test_4.json
```

This command will extract all identifiable multiple-choice questions from the given PDF and save them to `extracted_questions_test_4.json`.

---

### Input Assumptions

This script is built with SAT Digital Practice PDFs in mind and assumes:

- Each question starts with a standalone number (e.g., 17)
- Answer choices are labeled A), B), C), D) (case-insensitive)
- Choices may span multiple lines
- There may be filler text, headers, or directions that should be ignored
- The PDF text is extractable (not a scanned image or image-based PDF)

---

## High-Level Design

### 1. Argument Parsing

The script uses `argparse` to accept:

- `input_pdf`: the path to the PDF file
- `output_json`: the desired output file path

---

### 2. PDF Reading

Uses `pypdf.PdfReader` to extract text from every page:

```python
reader = PdfReader(args.input_pdf)
```

---

### 3. Text Cleaning

#### Skipping Pages

A set of regex patterns filters out entire pages that contain known filler text like:

- `No Test Material On This Page`
- `Make time to take the practice test`
- Empty or whitespace-only pages

#### Skipping Lines

A separate set of patterns removes lines like:

- Headers: `Page 2`, `DIRECTIONS`, etc.
- Footers: `Unauthorized copying`, etc.
- Module metadata like `Module 3` followed by a number

These filters ensure only relevant question/option content is retained.

---

### 4. Question Extraction Logic

The script loops through cleaned lines and:

- Detects a question number (e.g., 23)
- Looks ahead for A), B), etc. to confirm itâ€™s a multiple-choice question
- Collects question text and options (supports multi-line options)
- Builds structured dictionaries like:

```json
  {
    "question_id": "1",
    "question_type": "single_choice",
    "question_text": "The spacecraft OSIRIS-REx briefly made contact with the asteroid 101955 Bennu in 2020. NASA scientist Daniella DellaGiustina reports that despite facing the unexpected obstacle of a surface mostly covered in boulders, OSIRIS-REx successfully _______ a sample of the surface, gathering pieces of it to bring back to Earth. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
    "options": [
      {
        "key": "A",
        "text": "attached"
      },
      {
        "key": "B",
        "text": "collected"
      },
      {
        "key": "C",
        "text": "followed"
      },
      {
        "key": "D",
        "text": "replaced"
      }
    ]
  }
```

---

### 5. Output to JSON

At the end, the full list of extracted questions is dumped to the specified JSON file using:

```python
json.dump(questions, f, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)
```

---

## File Structure

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ extract_questions.py              # Main script
â”œâ”€â”€ sat-practice-test-4-digital.pdf  # Input PDF (example)
â”œâ”€â”€ extracted_questions_test_4.json         # Output (example
â”œâ”€â”€ sat-practice-test-5-digital.pdf  # Input PDF (example)
â”œâ”€â”€ extracted_questions_test_5.json         # Output (example)
â”œâ”€â”€ sat-practice-test-6-digital.pdf  # Input PDF (example)
â”œâ”€â”€ extracted_questions_test_6.json         # Output (example)
â””â”€â”€ README.md                        # This file
```

## ðŸ§ª Dependencies

- Python 3.7+
- `pypdf`

Install with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Regex Filters

### Page Skip Patterns

```python
UNWANTED_PAGE_PATTERNS = [
    r'^\s*$',
    r'No Test Material On This Page',
    r'Test begins on the next page',
    r'Make time to take the practice test'
]
```

### Line Skip Patterns

```python
SKIP_PATTERNS = [
    r'^\s*\d+\s*QUESTIONS',
    r'^\s*DIRECTIONS',
    r'^\s*The questions in this section',
    r'^\s*All questions in this section',
    r'^\s*Unauthorized copying',
    r'^\s*If you finish',
    r'^\s*Continue',
    r'^\s*Page\s*\d+',
    r'^\s*$',
    r'^\.{5,}$'
]
```

---

## Assumptions

- Only multiple-choice questions are extracted
- Non-MCQs like grid-ins or short answers are ignored
- All options start with A), B), etc.
- The format follows typical SAT Digital layout

---

## Future Improvements

- Add OCR support for scanned/image-based PDFs
- Add LATEX for equations
- Extract graphs/tables etc.
- Auto-detect answer keys (if embedded)
